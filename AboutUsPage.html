  <p>
    Pearly’s Pooches Pet Photography is run by myself, Cheryl, and my partner Tom. We also own Pearly's Pooches Dog
    Walking. Part of making our walks special for our clients is taking photos of their beloved pets. This lets them see
    what their pooch gets up on a walk and also provides some cherished memories.<br>
    <br>
    We want to create special moments for your pets and you by capturing candid images that can either be provided on a
    USB memory stick or can be printed in a photobook for an additional cost. Although we primarily cover Blantyre,
    Hamilton and Bothwell, we can offer our services further afield for an additional cost. Please see our pricing
    structure for more information.<br>

  <h4>More about Pearly's Pooches Dog Walking</h4>
  <p>
    It all started in 2010 after I had finishing studying Sports Coaching at Glasgow City College. I wanted a job where
    I could take my young Dalmatian, Bo, along with me. This led me on to dog walking, which as a child would’ve been my
    dream job. I applied for a business loan from the Prince’s Trust to help get me started and this allowed me to buy
    the Pearly’s Pooches mobile and promote my services.<br>
    <br>
    In 2011 I started walking my first clients, Caley and Daisy, who were two lovely Boxers!
    I have studied canine behaviour and training, and the psychology of dogs on an online college course. This has been
    beneficial in being able to read a dog’s body language and be able to assess different situations. I am experienced
    in handling groups of up to six dogs, which allows them to play, socialise and have fun. Over the years I have
    handled many different breeds and sizes of dogs, all with different behaviours and temperaments.<br>>
    <br>
    I have always loved animals, especially dogs. The Pearly’s Pooches logo was inspired by my own Dalmatian, Bo. We
    brought Bo home in 2009 and she is the original leader of the Pearly’s Pooches pack. She’s since been joined by my
    two Siberian Huskies, Nanuke and Roman, both of whom belonged to previous clients of mine.
    <br>
    <br>
    All three of the dogs are extremely friendly and welcoming to new members of the gang. In 2019 Tom, my partner,
    started to join me on my morning walks before he attended his own work. He was a Project
    Manager of the Bellshill YMCA for 11 years and unfortunately due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, was
    furloughed and eventually made redundant in 2020. Due to Tom’s dog walking experience and the growth of the
    business, it seemed the natural step for him to
    officially
    join the Pearly’s Pooches gang as our second walker. Tom is amazing with the dogs and loves them as much as I do. He
    is already a new favourite of the dogs and loves
    being outdoors every day with them.
